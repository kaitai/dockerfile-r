Get my handwritten notes about TDA at https://1drv.ms/o/s!AhW4LVEyYA8qjQDsaIcUN6uGsKWP .

# You can launch this binder using R by clicking on the badge:

From the repo I forked this from:
"While Python and Julia are the only two languages natively supported with

"This repository shows how you can use a Dockerfile to install R and
connect it with Jupyter. This lets you run R code from within the Jupyter Notebooks."
