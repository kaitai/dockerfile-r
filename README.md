# For Day of Data 2018:

Get my handwritten notes about TDA at https://1drv.ms/o/s!AhW4LVEyYA8qjQDsaIcUN6uGsKWP . 

I'll try to put up a bibliography, too. For now, note that you can look up names like Gurjeet Singh and Gunnar Carlsson to find some of the original papers in the field.


# You can launch this binder using R by clicking on the badge:

From the repo I forked this from:
"While Python and Julia are the only two languages natively supported with
build files, it's possible to create R Kernels for use with Binder as well.

"This repository shows how you can use a Dockerfile to install R and
connect it with Jupyter. This lets you run R code from within the Jupyter Notebooks."

Day of Data 2018 was organized at the University of Minnesota by Alison Link -- it was a great conference, bringing together people from all parts of the University community. Michael Milligan from the Minnesota Supercomputing Institute was also crucial to getting this interactive notebook up and working -- this R on Jupyter via Docker is pretty cool!
